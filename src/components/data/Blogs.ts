    title: 'What is a RESTful API & Why Does It Matter?',
    content:
      'RESTful APIs are a way for systems to communicate over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. They are essential for structuring scalable backend systems. REST APIs use resources (URLs) and return data typically in JSON format. This architecture is stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed for the server to process it. REST is widely used in modern web development due to its simplicity, flexibility, and support across tools and languages.',
